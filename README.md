# CmdStack

CmdStack is a CLI command management solution designed to help developers avoid the hassle of maintaining scattered Notepad or text files full of command stashes. It provides a unified CLI and GUI experience to store, manage, and execute your favourite CLI commands with ease. Currently available on MacOS, CmdStack streamlines your CLI workflow and allows you to focus on what matters.

## Features

- **Hierarchical Organization:** Group similar commands into hierarchical folders by labelling them with tags
- **Easy Search:** Search for the command you need by the command contents and/or tag
- **Instant Execution:** Run your commands directly from both of our applications, allowing you to execute your commands efficiently in the terminal of your choice
- **Random Value Generation:** Forget about searching for online generators for random UUIDs, integers, or strings – CmdStack can dynamically generate random values within your commands on demand
- **Interactive Input:** Adapt your commands on the fly with blank placeholders that you can fill in on each use
- **Import/Export:** Easily import and export your entire command stack from the CLI in JSON format – your data always stays under your control
- **No Telemetry:** CmdStack collects no data and thus requires no internet access

### Dynamic Command Customization

One of the standout features of CmdStack is its ability to customize commands saved in your stack dynamically through the use of the following syntax. This has the benefit of increasing the flexibility of your saved commands.

- **Non-Blank Parameters:** 
  - **String:** `@{string[min,max]}`
  - **Integer:** `@{int[min,max]}`
  - **Boolean:** `@{bool}`
  - **UUID:** `@{uuid}`
- **Blank Parameter:** `@{}`

For non-blank parameters, CmdStack will dynamically substitute placeholders with random strings (or integers, booleans, etc.) in the selected command. 

For blank parameters, you will be asked for input when selecting a command. The inputs you provide will replace the blank parameter in the command.

For `@{string[min,max]}` and `@{int[min,max]}`, the `[min,max]` arguments are optional. If they are excluded, the default is `[5,10]`. 

#### Example

Suppose you saved the following command in CmdStack. 

```
aws rds create-db-instance –db-instance-identifier @{string[5,9]} –allocated-storage @{} –db-instance-class db.t2.micro –port @{int[5432,5439]}
```

This command has two non-blank parameters and one blank parameter. The non-blank parameters are:
1. `@{string[5,9]}` - A string parameter that is between 5 and 9 characters long
2. `@{int[5432,5439]}` - An integer parameter that lies between 5432 and 5439

When this command is viewed in the GUI or selected in the CLI, the non-blank parameters will be replaced with randomly generated values and the blank parameter will be populated with user input. If the value "256" is supplied for the blank parameter, the following might be the resultant command:

```
aws rds create-db-instance –db-instance-identifier 230wZGW –allocated-storage 256 –db-instance-class db.t2.micro –port 5439
```

## Usage

### CLI

The CmdStack CLI provides a set of operations to manage your command stack. Below is the help text generated by the CLI:

```
Usage: cmdstack <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add     Add a command to your stack
  update  Update a command in your stack
  delete  Delete a command in your stack
  search  Search for a command in your stack
  export  Export stack to a JSON file
  import  Import stack from a JSON file
  config  Modify the config values
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

### Command Execution Options

In both the CLI and the GUI, after your command is generated, you will have several options:
- **Edit before execution:** Make manual adjustments to your command, if required
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy the resultant command to your clipboard so you can paste it into any terminal
- **Direct Execution:** Run the command directly in Terminal or iTerm2
