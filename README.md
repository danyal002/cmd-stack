Currently available on Mac, `cmdstack` streamlines your command line workflow and ensures that you never lose those brilliant command ideas.

## Features

- **Easy Storage:** Keep your command snippets organized in one place.

  - **Boolean Parameters:** `@{bool}`
  - **UUID Parameters:** `@{uuid}`
  - **Blank Parameters:** `@{}` (prompts for input at runtime)
- **Flexible Command Execution:** Choose to execute the final command directly in Terminal or iTerm2, or simply copy it to your clipboard for later use.
- **CRUD Operations:** Easily add, update, delete, and search commands in your stack.
- **Import/Export:** Seamlessly backup or share your command stacks in JSON format.
- **Configurable:** Modify settings to suit your personal workflow.

## Usage

### CLI Commands

The `cmdstack` CLI provides a set of basic CRUD operations to manage your command stack. Below is the help text generated by the CLI:

```
Usage: `cmdstack` <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add     Add a command to your stack
  update  Update a command in your stack
  delete  Delete a command in your stack
  search  Search for a command in your stack
  export  Export stack to a JSON file
  import  Import stack from a JSON file
  config  Modify the config values
  help    Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```


### Parameterization Syntax
One of the standout features of `cmdstack` is its ability to handle parameterized commands. You can define dynamic segments in your commands using the following syntax:

- **String:** `@{string[min,max]}`
- **Number:** `@{number[min,max]}`
- **Boolean:** `@{bool}`
- **UUID:** `@{uuid}`
- **Blank Parameter:** `@{}`

    This will prompt you for input when the command is executed.

The idea is that every time you search for one of the non-blank parameters, random strings (or numbers, booleans, UUIDs) are generated so you donâ€™t have to go online to build your entire command. For blank parameters, you'll be asked for input, ensuring that dynamic values are filled at runtime.

#### Example

```
docker run --name @{string} -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=@{string[6,12]} -d postgres
```

When executed, this might generate something like:

```
docker run --name QbNDf -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=E31rNc -d postgres
```

### Command Execution Options

After your command is generated (with parameters substituted), you have several options:

- **Edit before execution:** Make manual adjustments before running.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Automatically copy the resultant command so you can paste it into any terminal.
- **Direct Execution:** Run the command directly in your Terminal or iTerm2.
